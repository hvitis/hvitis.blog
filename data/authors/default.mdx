On this page you could see projects that I have developed over my career. Well, the one that stayed (there was more of it). The lesson is that the best software is software that people need. This is one of the most important reasons for me to work on any code-related projects. Both at work and in my leisure time. Yes, some enjoy coding on the balcony on Saturdays!

Here are some specific examples of my experience and skills:

As a developer, I have experience with a variety of programming languages and technologies, including Java, Python, JavaScript, React, and Angular. I am also proficient in a variety of testing tools and techniques, such as Selenium, JUnit, and Postman.

My main proffession (which I enjoy the most) is assuring quality of software. As a QA, I have experience developing and maintaining automated test suites for a variety of software applications. I am also skilled in using continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the software development process.

As a product owner, I have experience working with cross-functional teams to gather requirements, define user stories, and prioritize features. I am also skilled in using agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban to manage software development projects.

I am also a passionate reader, writer and - as you might have noticed - I like LEGO. If you have any idea regarding [Mosaic Art Maker](/mosaic-art-maker) or any other bussiness you can [just tell me](/contact).
