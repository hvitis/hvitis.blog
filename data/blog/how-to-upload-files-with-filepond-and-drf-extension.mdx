## Integrating DRF with Filepond VueJS

Why? Because it is amazing out-of-the-box solution for Pythonists. Just have a quick look:

![FilepondDjango](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pqina/filepond-github-assets/master/filepond-animation-01.gif 'How to upload pictures via front end app to django rest backend')

There is a Django REST Framework plugin for uploading pictures via Filepond components. It works amazing! Filepond has everything you might need for uploading pictures. Everything neatly works together and I am really happy after using it. Works on different browsers, integrates with Amazin S3 and has powerful options.

Django is known to be cumbersome when uploading pictures. Thank god we have a ready to use solution that neatly integrates with Filepond. There has been some issues when understanding the _docs_ in my case that is why I decided to make a tutorial.

> Goal: Integrate django-drf-filepond with vue-filepond

What we need to do:

1. Install and customize [Filepond VueJS][1]
2. Install and customize [DRF filepond][0]
3. Prepare backend endpoint
4. Upload picture
   **extras**
5. Nuxt.JS filepond implementation.

## 1. Install and customize

Generally it is pretty straight-forward. You can follow the official **docs** at the official repo[1]. The most important part that is omitted there is that when installing and placing the VueJS component on your front-end remember to change **name** to **filepond**:

```js
<file-pond
    name="filepond"
    ref="pond"
    label-idle="Drop file here..."
    v-bind:allow-multiple="false"
    accepted-file-types="image/jpeg, image/png, image/jpg"
    v-bind:files="myFiles"
    v-on:init="handleFilePondInit"                     <-- Example optional hook
    v-on:processfile="handleFilePondSuccessProcessed"  <-- Hook we use to get UID
    :server="serverOptions"
/>
```

Then handle plugins and set options for the component's way of connecting with your backend according to the official _docs_. Check out [my gist][3] if you are having problems. üíÅüèª

## 3. Install and customize DRF filepond

Install the pip package and add necessarry settings.
Here is basic implementation for local and prod env:

```python
if DEBUG:
    # Use a location on a local filesystem on the host server for file storage
    DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_FILE_STORE_PATH = os.path.join(
        BASE_DIR, 'stored_uploads')

if not DEBUG:
    # Required for FILEPOND
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = env('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = env('AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME')
    AWS_AUTO_CREATE_BUCKET = True
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-1'
    # AWS_DEFAULT_ACL = 'public-read'
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # s3 static settings
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}/'
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'storages.backends.s3boto3.S3Boto3Storage'

    # Use a remote file storage backend via the django-storages library
    #  for the Amazon S3 backend:
    DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_STORAGES_BACKEND = STATICFILES_STORAGE
    DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_FILE_STORE_PATH = None

    # DigitalOcean workaround - makes files expire in 20 years.
    AWS_QUERYSTRING_EXPIRE = 6220800000 # 20 years

    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'core.storage_backends.PublicMediaStorage'

###############
# FILE UPLOAD #
###############

DJANGO_DRF_FILEPOND_UPLOAD_TMP = os.path.join(
    BASE_DIR, 'filepond-temp-uploads')
```

Specified settings for media storage:

```python
#core/storage_backends.py

class PublicMediaStorage(BaseS3Storage):
    location = 'media'
    default_acl = 'public-read'
    file_overwrite = False
```

All this is basically AWS settings for **django-storages==1.9.1** package.
Last step here is adding **urls.py**

```python
urlpatterns = [
    #...
    path('fp/', include('django_drf_filepond.urls')),
    # ...
]
```

## 3. Prepare backend endpoint

Once we have all this, we can start finally understanding how the basic file upload works. More detailed explanation of architecture you can find in _docs_ but also in [**my github issue**][4].

Basically: filepond saves the file and returns you UID which identifies the file. Then you can use this UID to fetch files from AWS (or your local storage when DEBUG=True). So the **UID is the information you want to store in the DB** in order to later retrieve the picture. Again - UID is obtained once filepond successfully uploads the picture using POST /process endpoint. This is done automatically and this action gives you UID.

In order to retrieve the picture call from POSTMAN:

**MY_LOCAL_OR_PROD_URL/fetch/?target=UID_SAVED_IN_DB**

Now let's finally make the endpoint to see what happens.

```python
class UploadPictureInformationAPIView(UpdateAPIView):


    def update(self, request, *args, **kwargs):
        # The upload_id is obtained from front-end after having successfully uploaded the picture.
        upload_id = request.data['upload_id']
        # Given a variable upload_id containing a 22-character unique file upload ID:
        if upload_id != '' and upload_id != None:
            su = store_upload(
                upload_id, destination_file_path='target_dir/{}.png'.format(upload_id))

        id = self.kwargs.get(self.lookup_url_kwarg)
        your_obj = YouObject.objects.filter(id=id).get()

         serializer = YouObjectSerializer(data=serializer, many=True)
        your_obj.is_valid()
        your_obj.save()
        # return Response(serializer.data, status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED)
```

This is your custom view:

```python
urlpatterns = [
    path("/<int:id>", UploadPictureInformationAPIView.as_view(), name="upload-picture-info"),
]
```

**So how to get the UID?**

You can use filepond hook that fires up when picture has been uploaded. Your DOM has now UID of all pictures that have been uploaded so you can retrieve it:

```js
handleFilePondSuccessProcessed: function() {
      // FilePond instance methods are available on `this.$refs.pond`
      this.upload_id = document.getElementsByClassName(
        "filepond--data"
      )[0].firstChild.value;
    },
```

Now we can use e.g. axios to send POST or PUT to our endpoint and include **this.upload_id**.

Let me know if that was helpful or if you want me to explain ir better / more.
