## Integrating DRF with Filepond ReactJS

Why? Because it is amazing out-of-the-box solution for Pythonists. Just have a quick look:

![FilepondDjango](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pqina/filepond-github-assets/master/filepond-animation-01.gif 'How to upload pictures via front end app to django rest backend')

There is a Django REST Framework plugin for uploading pictures via Filepond components. It works amazing! Filepond has everything you might need for uploading pictures. Everything neatly works together and I am really happy after using it. Works on different browsers, integrates with Amazin S3 and has powerful options.

[Here][8] you can check it live in action. (_It's on heroku so you need to wait a lot to boot it up (and refresh the page if you get timedout)._)

Django is known to be cumbersome when uploading pictures. Thank god we have a ready to use solution that neatly integrates with Filepond. There has been some issues when understanding the _docs_ in my case that is why I decided to make a tutorial.

> Goal: Integrate django-drf-filepond with react-filepond

**What we need to do:**

In the previous [tutorial on Filepond VueJS][3] I wrote more on how to use DRF extension. Here I want to show you a piece of front-end code and give you [boilerplate on github][5] that you can discover on your own.

You can also deploy it directly to heroku by clicking on the button.

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/hvitis/django-rest-filepond-react-js)

( for more useful repos ready to deploy check out [post on heroku buttons][7] )

## React component settings

Generally it is pretty straight-forward. You can follow the official **docs** at [the official repo][1]. The most important part that is omitted there is that when installing and placing the VueJS component on your front-end remember to change **name** to **filepond**. In ReactJS case it is important also to change **server** to our DRF endpoints _fp/process/_ to POST an upload.

```js
<FilePond
  ref={(ref) => (this.pond = ref)}
  files={this.state.files}
  allowMultiple={true}
  allowReorder={true}
  maxFiles={3}
  server="http://127.0.0.1:8000/fp/process/"
  name="filepond"
  oninit={() => this.handleInit()}
  onupdatefiles={(fileItems) => {
    // Set currently active file objects to this.state
    this.setState({
      files: fileItems.map((fileItem) => fileItem.file),
    })
  }}
/>
```

Handling all the class, functions and setState you can check out [in the repo's file][6] if you are having problems. üíÅüèª

This is how it looks like when using on deployed heroku version:

Let me know if that was helpful or if you want me to explain it better / more.
