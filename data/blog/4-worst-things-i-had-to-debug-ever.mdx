## What to do when you're stuck in a dead end?

First of course logs from errors, then debugging with your IDE, then stackOverflow, then second page of Google but what if? What if nothing helps?

What has worked for me in all of those cases was just starting all over again.
Whether it means to start from last commit, from reinstalling the repo, or the project itself. After certain time for a break - your mind thinks differently after 1 hour of not having conscious filled with THE ERROR.

## List of worst BUGs 🐞 I will remember until I die

#### The famous dash hyphen npm ^ ~ package updates

If you check your package.json then all the packages have a version with 2 dots like 1.2.3
That's because they follow format where each number has a name: [major, minor, patch]
So in 1.2.3
1 is major
2 is minor
3 is update

A tilde (`~`), a caret (`^`), an asterisk (`*`) are [some of the characters seen in package.json][0] file used to define a npm package version.

```JSON
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "dependencies": {
    "axios": "~0.18.0",
    "gatsby-plugin-typescript": "^2.0.12"
  }
}
```

npm uses difference characters to state updates for the packages (e.g. when you run `npm update`). So what's the difference between tilde (`~`) and caret (`^`) in package.json?

##### [major, minor, patch]

- [tilde ranges][1] (~) will update but will not increment [major, __minor__, patch] value if it is specified; otherwise will update but will not increment [__major__, minor, patch] value.

  ~1.2.3 here minor value IS specified so it will keep updating until 1.2.9 (next one would be 1.3 which is forbidden).
  ~1 here minor value IS NOT specified so it will keep updating until 1.9.9 (next one would be 2 which is forbidden)

- [caret ranges][2] (^) will update but will not increment [__the left-most non-zero element__] value.
  ^0.0.1 **WILL NOT** install 0.0.2 and above but **WILL** install e.g. 0.0.12
  ^0.1.0 **WILL NOT** install 0.2.0 and above but **WILL** install e.g. 0.1.8
  ^1.0.0 **WILL NOT** install 2.0.0 and above but **WILL** install e.g. 1.8.56

It is used to install version that has no breaking changes because:

> However, it presumes that there will not be breaking changes between 0.2.4 and 0.2.5.

we basically we need to trust the developers of the package that the update will not break our app. Apparently the developers changing package that I was using in my app were not accustomed with this rules and the bug was caused by the fact that I did _npm update_ for some reason. After hopelessly trying to debug I cleaned the _node_modules_ and did _npm install_ again which solved it.

#### Change of filename's capital letter not picked up

Procfile is a thing specific to Python. A Procfile is a mechanism for declaring what commands are run by your application.

According to heroku:

> The Procfile is always a simple text file that is named Procfile without a file extension. For example, Procfile.txt is not valid.
> The Procfile must live in your app’s root directory. It does not function if placed anywhere else.

In theory they wrote it right and I the fault is mine. The mistake was that I wrote the file by hand and I typed it as _procfile_ so not with capital letter.
This was causing bauild to silently fail and I had completly no idea what was causing it.

The problem was huge because changing the letters to uppercase was not picked up by git - mine or heroku's, I don't remember anymore, so [I was trying the solution][1] and was not working until I deleted the file and uploaded it again.

#### Reacts wrap `<div>` in a component

That was back when I was learning React and I've decided to create some simple project. In order to create a component you needed to wrap it in a div like that:

```JS
import React from 'react';

class ComputerGreeting extends React.Component {
  render(){
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello Human.</h1>;
        <p>Pleased to serve you.</p>;
      <div/>
  }
}
```

Then they implemented React Fragments so that creating useless divs that get rendered and mess up with your mind is not longer necessarry. The code would look like that then:

```JS
import React from 'react';

class ComputerGreeting extends React.Component {
  render(){
    return (
       <React.Fragment>
        <h1>Hello Human.</h1>;
        <p>Pleased to serve you.</p>;
       <React.Fragment/>
  }
}
```

Then they implemented another syntax to wrap up a component with:

```JS
import React from 'react';

class ComputerGreeting extends React.Component {
  render(){
    return (
       <>
        <h1>Hello Human.</h1>;
        <p>Pleased to serve you.</p>;
       </>
  }
}
```

But on the very beginning, when I was trying to make some Bootstrap template into React but I forgot the fact that you **HAVE TO** wrap a component with an element that will actually make it a singular piece.
And it took me ages. Again, what has helped was taking a break and trying to follow the error message.

#### Node version that is the cause of an error

There is a tool that is called POSTMAN and it has it's command line equivalent called NEWMAN. There is also an npm package. Putting it simply - It's a tool for helping people with API. The first one is GUI equivalent with a sandbox for JavaScript code and the second one is just runner for collections of tests and requests that the first one generates.

I was trying to export a tests collection from the POSTMAN and run it on NEWMAN. I had an error that was impossible to debug. The CLI was not very verbose and there was tons of variables that could have gone wrong on the way.

I was surprised that after trying 20000 solutions I was still stuck. I even have changed the node versions twice to different once. The way out was reaching out for help and [creating an Issue on gitHub][0].

The help solution was to change the node version - but **I DID IT**! So I changed it again to even lower versions and **IT WORKED**!

From that moment when I try a solution I try all the possibilities of that solution...
