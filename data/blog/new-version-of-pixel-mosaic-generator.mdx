# Mosaic Art creator version 2.0

New updated generator and upcoming changes. Read what has changed and what is next!

Check the new version of **LEGO mosaic maker** [here](/mosaic-art-maker).

## The History

It is now September of 2023 and almost [3 years ago](https://hvitis.dev/mosaic-art-creator-mosaic-and-portraits-free-online-editor) I went to Denmark and made myself a quite expensive picture in [Portrait Booth](https://petapixel.com/2017/03/02/lego-photo-booth-helps-build-portrait-bricks/). The photo quality was not so good and I had just one shot. After coming home I decided to make it better but found no alternatives online.

Then I decided to work on [mosaic generator](/mosaic-art-maker) to have at least something better than my lego portrait and published first version of the [mosaic maker](/mosaic-art-maker). People started using it and soon after they started writing to me with ideas and suggestions. LEGO maker got great reviewes which pushed me to code (and learn) more and more. The market was changing in paralell. LEGO Dots came to market, more LEGO sets. I was adding new color sets to the website and playing around with other ideas and functionalities.

Then, due to limitations of my knowledge and technology I paused the development. During those years I have learned more things and finally decided to update the program which results you can see now.

## The Changes

### The old version

Quite simple (but functional!). Interface was difficult to use. Selectors were small, not styled and options were confusing to use (depended on each other in ways that even I did not know).

### The new version

Quite amazing (but modest!). Interface is very functional (especially setting the board size), styling is neat and consistent. All the functionalities are preserved and expended. Let's see what is new!

Starting from the top:

1. File input has a pulsating reminder that reminds you about uploading picture first (in case you are new here or you want to refresh the page). Pictures can now have more formats to create mosaic even easier!
2. It is now possible to set **rectangles** as the result mosaic. Also there is a possibility to create mosaic in every dimension starting from 10 up to 64! Board size setting slider allows you to quicky adjust and in case you need rectangle mode - set required size in custom input. This allows you to use smaller sizes than your base plates which **creates frames** for your art and portraits.
3. Lego Art sets has a dropdown list that allows to mix colors from multiple sets. You can also see the photos of available set colors and description. If you have a set that you use but is not on the list - [let me know](/contact).

4. It is possible to use list of customly selected colors ( one by one ). You can now create mosaic in shades of favourite colors and edit them in both round and square tiles mode. Edit mode is always on in case you want to adjust generated mosaic.
5. Better feedback in case of missing input is communicated via notifications in the bottom right corner and yellow text.

6. All functionalities of exporting has been preserved so you can generate .png pictures with the results and more. I will soon better describe how you can use other formats. (see below in section 'what is next' )
7. After generating mosaic there is a list of colors used during generation. Click on a color and edit the mosaic's imperfections with it!
8. When you convert picture to mosaic tiles, there is information about cost of your mosaic in different currencies in case you want to buy studs yourself!


Of course **entire lego mosaic generator is free** and it **does not save pictures** used for generating mosaics ( works online and offline - you can even switch off the internet and it will work )

## What is next

First of all - You! Your feedback. All that would not be possible to achieve without feedback. Some people found bugs, some people told me about new mosaic sets, some about needs for other functionalities.

Second of all - DOTS. There is plenty of sets available and plenty of creativity. New tiles, shapes, colors. With LEGO DOTS kids can learn letters and adults can create patterns but what is most important - you can mix those sets with LEGO Art sets!

All that opens imagination to new frontiers! So many possibilities. Maybe generating optical ilusions? Maybe adding DOTS names to portraits? Maybe something else?

Here **you** come in! I have opened [a board](https://trello.com/b/bg7dK05a/mosaic-art-generator) with tasks that I will be working on. If you want, you can comment on those tasks, like them or just see the progress on next version. You can also [write me](/contact) if you don't want to create an account there.

And finally - thank you!

## Sum up

LEGO Mosaic generator is more pleasant to work with. It will have more features with time. You can see this process for yourself. Next major release should have functionalities for LEGO DOTS generator - not only bracelets but more alternative builds.

If you want to use your money well - rebuild, have fun, alter, vary. Live!

See you soon and thanks for reading!
