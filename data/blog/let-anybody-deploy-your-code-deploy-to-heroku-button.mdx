## What's the magic method and why it's so useful?

_TLDR:_ [My list of free, interesting software](#best-instant-apps-ready-to-be-deployed).

You may find yourself in one of 2 situations:

- You've just finished your project and want others to see it / use it.
- You don't want to build ( or pay ) another commonly used app.

Both of those can be solved in seconds or minutes with Deploy Buttons. There is many, many hosting providers that offer quick deploy solutions. On DigitalOcean you can find [many different solutions][1] (from [Security][0], Analytics to eCommerce, Chats, Forums) that you can host immediately on a 'droplet' but it will cost you at [least 5\$ / month][2]. There is [Azure solution][3] of instant deploys but it also has it's price.

The reson I want to explain [Heroku solution][7] is because it can be both simple and [free][5]. You can expand tiers, complexity etc later and pay for it but in case you don't like the solution or the app you're trying - you can just delete it and forget it. Without paying a dime (even if the deploy requires [paid add-ons][4]).

## What's Deploy-to-Heroku button and how does it work?

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/PodcasterDJ/Podcaster)

By clicking this button you will start deploying [my open-source project][6] to your account (assuming you have one). Your database, your env variables, your app! You can choose [one of hundreds][7] applications ready to be deployed. Scroll down to see [the most interesting](#best-instant-apps-ready-to-be-deployed) apps ( in my opinion ) ready to be deployed. Stick around if you want to see the full potential and create your own.

### What can the button do and how?

In order for the button to work you have to host the code on GitHub - that's the only requirement. The button calls heroku and let's it scan the repo for **app.json** file.

This file has every piece of information needed to perform the deploy. The list of commands is [very long][9] but out of [basic settings][10] thatere is **none** that is essential. Yes, you _don't even need app.json file_. You just need the button in a README on your GitHub repository.

```html

```

If you want a better introduction, check the [voice log][11] on the button that explains in details the idea. This is how easy it is.

Worth mentioning is the fact that the button works on **private and public repositories**. That means that you can use the button also in your organisation. GitHub has just changes it's [pricing tiers][12] and you can run your organisation with private repositories. As long as you don't need [more features][12] you will pay 0 \$. Thank you Microsoft!
