##  Intro

How many times we have heared the word "automation"? Probably so many times that it became natural to us. The process of removing the "human factor" (or to fire a collegue - speaking in plain english) is getting faster. Now the ultimate goal is to make code write itself and there are three reasons for it:
- It sounds fun and we humans feel incredibly accomplished when we control the machine and make it even pretend to think for us.
- It is cheaper - thoughts are extremly difficult to obtain (education and conditions to obtain them take a long time)
- Final and probably the most relevant and influential - it is not natural to write, let alone to write code. In order to write, one needs to know to to read and although that skill has gotten more popular over the years:
