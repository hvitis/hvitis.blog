## How to make beautiful, responsive, gallery in Django

> There is [repo on GitHub][3] in case you want to clone the code.

I was struggling many times with making my own custom Gallery or with just adding different options for photos. What is the reason of reinventing the wheel? I did not know this solution and I was tired of reviewing apps and repos that are [not maintained anymore][4].

The lightbox itself is an old technology but [it's maintained and alive][6]. Works very well and out of the box. You can [see some examples here][5] on how smoot it works.

The photologue is also maintained and it has amazing functionalities (see below). It also works with AWS Amazon S3 Bucket.

- **This is how it looks like** in the Template. It's possible navigate with keyboard between the images and the transition is great.

## Let's code it

To implement it in your app you need to do a few things:

1. [Download lightbox][6] and unzip it. I would not recommend adding CDN since there are different versions and some of them require initializing the galleries separately.

2. Load JS and CSS as static files. You can load a lightbox+jquery file from zipped package or you can load just lightbox JS in case you are already using JQuery.

```html

	<link href="{% static 'lightbox.css' %}" rel="stylesheet">
</head>

...
    <script src="{% static 'lightbox-plus-jquery.js' %}"></script>
</body>
```

Don't forget about

```
python3 manage.py collectstatic
```

3. [Install photologue][7] and extend your model that has photos/gallery. In my case it¬¥s a blog post and FOreignKey. Your case might be different. Everything depends on [DB relations][8] you need to apply.

```python
from django.db import models
from photologue.models import Gallery
# Create your models here.
class Post(models.Model):
    gallery = models.ForeignKey(Gallery, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True)

    title = models.CharField(max_length=199)
    content = models.TextField()

    ...
```

4. Pass your models to views.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import Post

def homepage(request):
    post_list = Post.objects.all()
    context = {}
    context['post_list'] = post_list
    return render(request, 'base.html', context)
```

Add the view to URL

```
urlpatterns = [
    path('', homepage, name='homepage'),
]
```

4. Iterate through gallery loaded into Template context.

```html
<div class="container">
  {% for post in post_list %}
  <h1>{{post.title}}</h1>
  <p>{{post.content}}</p>

  <div class="row">
    {% for photo in post.gallery.sample %}
    <a
      class="align-self-center"
      title="{{ photo.title }}"
      href="{{ photo.get_display_url }}"
      data-lightbox="gallery-example"
      max-height="150px"
    >
      <img src="{{ photo.get_thumbnail_url }}" />
    </a>
    {% endfor %}
  </div>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
```

The Photologue has _get_display_url_ for big photos and _get_thumbnail_url_ for thumbnails. You can **customize their sizes**, effects and more in your Django admin!

The only thing to make lightbox 2 work is part of HTML tag:

```
data-lightbox="NAME_OF_YOUR_GALLERY"
```

so don¬¥t miss it! Also in case you want to have more than one galleries remember to change those tags e.g. :

```

<a href="{{ photo.get_display_url }}" data-lightbox="FIRST_GALLERY" max-height="150px"><img src="{{ photo.get_thumbnail_url }}" ></a>
<a href="{{ photo.get_display_url }}" data-lightbox="FIRST_GALLERY" max-height="150px"><img src="{{ photo.get_thumbnail_url }}" ></a>
<a href="{{ photo.get_display_url }}" data-lightbox="FIRST_GALLERY" max-height="150px"><img src="{{ photo.get_thumbnail_url }}" ></a>


<a href="{{ photo.get_display_url }}" data-lightbox="SECOND_GALLERY" max-height="150px"><img src="{{ photo.get_thumbnail_url }}" ></a>
<a href="{{ photo.get_display_url }}" data-lightbox="SECOND_GALLERY" max-height="150px"><img src="{{ photo.get_thumbnail_url }}" ></a>
```

I hope this üñºÔ∏è Gallery solution came in handy!
