## Core of Robot Framework

This is not Python addon! I know you might have heard a lot of times that Robot and Python go together but ...

## Setting up Docker

In order to quickly start learning by doing let us execute the tests in the best was possible which is of course with Docker. We are going to be using Docker image that has Robot Framework with additional libraries such as [Selenium][2]. This was we should worry only about our tests. Later on Docker should enable you also easy CICD implementation.

I am going to use [this Docker image][0] (you might need a docker account to [see it][1]). You can create your own by [reading official tutorial][3].

Let's create a simple docker compose file:

```
services:

  robot:
    image: ppodgorsek/robot-framework:latest
    container_name: robot
    restart: always
    user: root
    volumes:
       - ./tests:/tests
    environment:
      WORKSPACE: '/tests:/tests'
      BROWSER: 'chrome'
      ROBOT_TESTS_DIR: "$WORKSPACE/tests/robot/tests/e2e/"
      ROBOT_REPORTS_DIR: "$WORKSPACE/tests/reports/robot/"

    network_mode: "host"

    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

This docker-compose.yml file assumes the following:
- That this file is within a folder with tests catalog
- That you will be running an app on localhost

If you want this service to be a part of docker compose that has backend or frontend service that you want to test, simply delete the network_mode and add shared network.


```
    networks:
      - sharednetwork
networks:
  sharednetwork:
```

Now in the folder _/tests/robot/tests/e2e/_ we will place a file called __login.robot__

```
*** Test Cases ***


Verify setup
    Log To Console    The docker executes my tests!


```

Now after running command:

```
docker compose up
```

You should see something like this:

![use test robot from within docker](/static/images/blog/2023-12-06/docker-terminal-host-robot-framework.jpg 'Robot Framework')


##  Robot Framework Usage and Examples

Now we can add on to the previous crude example:

```
*** Settings ***
Library     SeleniumLibrary

*** Variables ***
${BROWSER}    Chrome
${URL}        https://ADDRESS_TO_YOUR_TEST_PAGE


*** Test Cases ***


First test
    Log To Console    Opening the browser.
    Open Browser    ${URL}    ${BROWSER}
    Close Browser

```

Nowe we will check if the Selenium addon works fine. If so, proceed to add an actual test. On this blog there is a page with project. You can [create mosaic there][4] and we will be testing this functionality now.

Because we will be creating multiple tests, we should begin each one with the same sequence of events. In our case open webpage at a specific address and make sure it loads correctly.

In order to achieve this we will create a keywords:

```
*** Keywords ***
Open Mosaic Page
    Open Browser   ${URL}     ${BROWSER}

```

This will allow us to write a following test case:

```

*** Test Cases ***

Page opens correctly
    Open Mosaic Page
    Element Text Should Be    id:title    Mosaic Art Maker
    Close Browser

```
