## Core of Robot Framework

This is not Python addon! I know you might have heard a lot of times that Robot and Python go together but it is only partially true.

It is correct that you can use Python with Robot Framework to create custom scripts but you can use Java as well.

If you think you can be fluent in Robot Framework immediately just by knowing Python then you are wrong. You need to master a couple of Robot syntax before using it.

In order to write test cases you will need to work hand in hand with documentation, especially Selenium (if you want to test frontend) in order to master the "spoke like" syntax.

Examples are:

1. Using 3 dots around section title in order to write section-specific code:

```
*** Variables ***

or

*** Tasks ***

or

*** Test Cases ***
```

2. Creating custom keywords and using [Gherkin][5] BDD syntax:

```
Test mosaic maker using bdd syntax
    Given The Mosaic Maker Is Open
    When The User Enters New Image
    And The BoardSize is Selected to 3
    Then The Result Should Be Minimum 500px wide
```

3. Mixing variables

There is a possibility to use variables that look like JavaScript one:

```
Set Test Variable    ${term}
```

and it is possible to [pass variables][6] to test cases e.g. by importing:

```
*** Settings ***
Resource    ../../../../testdata/variables/imports.resource
```



## Setting up Docker

In order to quickly start learning by doing let us execute the tests in the best was possible which is of course with Docker. We are going to be using Docker image that has Robot Framework with additional libraries such as [Selenium][2]. This was we should worry only about our tests. Later on Docker should enable you also easy CICD implementation.

I am going to use [this Docker image][0] (you might need a docker account to [see it][1]). You can create your own by [reading official tutorial][3].

Let's create a simple docker compose file:

```
services:

  robot:
    image: ppodgorsek/robot-framework:latest
    container_name: robot
    restart: always
    user: root
    volumes:
       - ./tests:/tests
    environment:
      WORKSPACE: '/tests:/tests'
      BROWSER: 'chrome'
      ROBOT_TESTS_DIR: "$WORKSPACE/tests/robot/tests/e2e/"
      ROBOT_REPORTS_DIR: "$WORKSPACE/tests/reports/robot/"

    network_mode: "host"

    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

This docker-compose.yml file assumes the following:
- That this file is within a folder with tests catalog
- That you will be running an app on localhost

If you want this service to be a part of docker compose that has backend or frontend service that you want to test, simply delete the network_mode and add shared network.


```
    networks:
      - sharednetwork
networks:
  sharednetwork:
```

Now in the folder _/tests/robot/tests/e2e/_ we will place a file called __login.robot__

```
*** Test Cases ***

Verify setup
    Log To Console    The docker executes my tests!

```

Now after running command:

```
docker compose up
```

You should see something like this:

![use test robot from within docker](/static/images/blog/2023-12-06/docker-terminal-host-robot-framework.jpg 'Robot Framework')


##  Robot Framework Usage and Examples

Now we can add on to the previous crude example:

```
*** Settings ***
Library     SeleniumLibrary

*** Variables ***
${BROWSER}    Chrome
${URL}        https://ADDRESS_TO_YOUR_TEST_PAGE


*** Test Cases ***


First test
    Log To Console    Opening the browser.
    Open Browser    ${URL}    ${BROWSER}
    Close Browser

```

Nowe we will check if the Selenium addon works fine. If so, proceed to add an actual test. On this blog there is a page with project. You can [create mosaic there][4] and we will be testing this functionality now.

Because we will be creating multiple tests, we should begin each one with the same sequence of events. In our case open webpage at a specific address and make sure it loads correctly.

In order to achieve this we will create a keywords:

```
*** Keywords ***
Open Mosaic Page
    Open Browser   ${URL}     ${BROWSER}
    Wait Until Element Is Visible    id:title

```

This will allow us to write a following test cases:

```

*** Test Cases ***

Page opens correctly
    Open Mosaic Page

Input changer induces slider change
    Open Mosaic Page
    Input Text     id:board-size    15
    Element Text Should Be    id:board-size-text    width 10 x height 105

Notification can be closed
    Element Text Should Be      id:notification-title    New version has arrived!
    Click Button                id:notification-close
    Element Should Not Be Visible    id:notification-title
```
